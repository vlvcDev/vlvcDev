<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Vincent ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p align="center">
  I'm a graduate student at Colorado School of Mines pursuing a Masters Thesis in Computer Science and Quantum Engineering. My current passion project is a daily game app where you are given 3 different puzzles to solve every day. The most difficult and compelling challenge in development has been my process of AI generating challenges in a way that feels natural and intuitive to people, even though AI has different ways of thinking. That being said, I have full stack experience in developing both mobile apps and websites, I've made a variety of AI applications and scripts for education, recreation, and data processing, I've done some experiments with simulations, graphics programming, and game development, and I've done research in cluster computing for affordable edge computing devices. Over all, my experience has taught me patience, critical thinking, and the value in struggle.
